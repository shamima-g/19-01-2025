Based on my review of the specification documents, I've identified the key screens that need wireframes for the InvestInsight application. This is a comprehensive investment operations app with 20 epics and many screens.

I've read all the documentation. This is a comprehensive specification for **InvestInsight**, an investment operations web application with:

- **20 epics** covering portfolio management, monthly/weekly workflows, multi-level approvals, and 25+ CRUD screens
- **Complex UI workflows** including file import dashboards, data confirmation checks, cashflow capture, and approval workflows
- **Multiple user roles** (Operations Lead, Analyst, L1/L2/L3 Approvers, Admin)

Before we proceed, I have two questions for you:

The ui-ux-designer agent has identified **14 key screens** for wireframing. Here's the proposed list:

---

## Proposed Wireframes (14 screens)

### Core Application Screens (Priority 1)
1. **Start Page** - Landing page with 2 tabs (Report Batches list, New Report Batch button)
2. **Portfolio File Dashboard** - Grid showing 7 file types per portfolio with status icons and re-import button
3. **File Import Popup** - Multi-purpose popup with step viewer, upload tab, cancel/retry buttons
4. **Other Files Dashboard** - Bloomberg/Custodian files (one file per row) with status icons
5. **Instrument Static Page** - Grid with collapsible columns, toggle views (summary vs all), export ISINs, upload file button
6. **Data Confirmation** - Page with 3 tabs (File Check, Main Data Check, Other Data Check)

### Approval & Workflow Screens (Priority 2)
7. **Approval Screen (L1/L2/L3)** - Generic approval page with approve/reject buttons and rejection reason modal
8. **Reject Final Reports** - L3 post-approval rejection page

### Weekly Process Screens (Priority 3)
9. **Projected Cashflows** - Capture form with step indicator, currency-based completion logic
10. **Actual Cashflows** - Page with 2 grids and step indicator
11. **Cashflow Rebalancing Recommendations** - 4 read-only grids with currency filter and action buttons
12. **Historical Cashflow** - Same as rebalancing but with report batch date filter

### Supporting Templates (Priority 4)
13. **Generic CRUD Template** - Standard Add/Edit/View/Audit pattern for 25+ screens
14. **Process Logs** - Grid with report date filter, searchable/exportable

---

**Excluded**: 25+ repetitive CRUD screens and 15+ audit trail screens (they'll use the Generic CRUD Template pattern)

---

**Do you approve this list of 14 wireframes?** Would you like to add, remove, or combine any screens?

## Proposed Screens for Monthly Process Workflow

Based on the specifications, I've identified the following screens that are specifically part of the **Monthly Process** workflow. I've organized them by the typical user journey through a monthly reporting cycle.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Understood! Let me refocus the wireframes on the **Monthly Process** screens specifically.

16. **Monthly Process Logs** - Workflow + approval logs
17. **File Process Logs** - File list with download

**Questions:**
1. Do you approve these 17 screens?
2. Should I add the **Monthly Process Workflow View** (orchestration/checklist page)?
3. Should I create a **Generic CRUD Template** for screens 6-10 (they follow the same pattern)?

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:03Z)**_

1. Yes I approve 17 screens
2. add the Monthly Process Workflow View (orchestration/checklist page
Then proceed with creating wireframes
