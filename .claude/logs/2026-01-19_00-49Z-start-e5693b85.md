I've read all the documentation. This is a comprehensive specification for **InvestInsight**, an investment operations web application with:

- **20 epics** covering portfolio management, monthly/weekly workflows, multi-level approvals, and 25+ CRUD screens
- **Complex UI workflows** including file import dashboards, data confirmation checks, cashflow capture, and approval workflows
- **Multiple user roles** (Operations Lead, Analyst, L1/L2/L3 Approvers, Admin)

The ui-ux-designer agent has identified **14 key screens** for wireframing. Here's the proposed list:

---

## Proposed Wireframes (14 screens)

### Core Application Screens (Priority 1)
1. **Start Page** - Landing page with 2 tabs (Report Batches list, New Report Batch button)
2. **Portfolio File Dashboard** - Grid showing 7 file types per portfolio with status icons and re-import button
3. **File Import Popup** - Multi-purpose popup with step viewer, upload tab, cancel/retry buttons
4. **Other Files Dashboard** - Bloomberg/Custodian files (one file per row) with status icons
5. **Instrument Static Page** - Grid with collapsible columns, toggle views (summary vs all), export ISINs, upload file button
6. **Data Confirmation** - Page with 3 tabs (File Check, Main Data Check, Other Data Check)

### Approval & Workflow Screens (Priority 2)
7. **Approval Screen (L1/L2/L3)** - Generic approval page with approve/reject buttons and rejection reason modal
8. **Reject Final Reports** - L3 post-approval rejection page

### Weekly Process Screens (Priority 3)
9. **Projected Cashflows** - Capture form with step indicator, currency-based completion logic
10. **Actual Cashflows** - Page with 2 grids and step indicator
11. **Cashflow Rebalancing Recommendations** - 4 read-only grids with currency filter and action buttons
12. **Historical Cashflow** - Same as rebalancing but with report batch date filter

### Supporting Templates (Priority 4)
13. **Generic CRUD Template** - Standard Add/Edit/View/Audit pattern for 25+ screens
14. **Process Logs** - Grid with report date filter, searchable/exportable

---

**Excluded**: 25+ repetitive CRUD screens and 15+ audit trail screens (they'll use the Generic CRUD Template pattern)

---

**Do you approve this list of 14 wireframes?** Would you like to add, remove, or combine any screens?

1. **Start Page** - 2 tabs: Report Batches (view batches/status) + New Report Batch
2. **Portfolio File Dashboard** - Grid with 7 file types per portfolio + status icons + re-import
3. **File Import Popup** - Step viewer, upload tab, cancel/retry buttons
4. **Other Files Dashboard** - Bloomberg/Custodian files (one per row)

### Phase 2: Data Maintenance & Enrichment (6 screens)
5. **Instrument Static Page** - Collapsible columns, toggle views, export ISINs, upload

### Phase 5: Monitoring (2 screens)
16. **Monthly Process Logs** - Workflow + approval logs
17. **File Process Logs** - File list with download

---

**Questions:**
1. Do you approve these 17 screens?
2. Should I add the **Monthly Process Workflow View** (orchestration/checklist page)?
3. Should I create a **Generic CRUD Template** for screens 6-10 (they follow the same pattern)?

The feature-planner has proposed **10 epics** for the Monthly Process. Here's the breakdown:

---

## Proposed Epics for Monthly Process

| # | Epic | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| **1** | Start Page & Report Batch Management | Landing page with Report Batches tab + New Report Batch creation |
| **2** | Portfolio File Import Dashboard | 7 file types per portfolio with status icons + import popup |
| **3** | Other Files Import Dashboard | Bloomberg/Custodian files with same import popup |
| **4** | Instrument Static Data Management | CRUD with collapsible columns, toggle views, ISIN export, upload |
| **5** | Market Data Maintenance | Credit Ratings (Retry Decision Flow), Index Prices, Duration/YTM, Beta |
| **6** | Custom Holding Capture | Manual holdings with Portfolio/Instrument dropdowns |
| **7** | Data Confirmation & Verification | 3 tabs: File Check, Main Data Check, Other Data Check |
| **8** | Multi-Level Approval Workflow | L1/L2/L3 approvals + Reject Final Reports |
| **9** | Monthly Process Monitoring & Logs | Monthly Process Logs + File Process Logs |
| **10** | Monthly Process Workflow Orchestration | Workflow view showing all phases and status |

---

## Build Order Rationale

1. **Epic 1** â†’ Entry point (can't proceed without a batch)
2. **Epic 2** â†’ Primary data import
3. **Epic 3** â†’ Secondary data import (reuses Epic 2 patterns)
4. **Epic 4** â†’ Reference data foundation
5. **Epic 5** â†’ Market data (depends on instruments)
6. **Epic 6** â†’ Custom holdings (depends on portfolios/instruments)
7. **Epic 7** â†’ Verification (after all data entry)
8. **Epic 8** â†’ Approvals (after data confirmation)
9. **Epic 9** â†’ Monitoring/audit
10. **Epic 10** â†’ Orchestration layer (ties everything together)

**Do you approve these 10 epics and their order?**

_Opened file: `c:\AI\19-01-2025\.claude\context\workflow-state.json`_

Yes I approve.  I have 1 question


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Great, the epics are approved! What's your question?

---


_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:32Z)**_

Why did you not clear the context after creating wireframes? I don't want you to do it now, I just want to know.


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Good question. The ui-ux-designer agent recommended clearing context after the DESIGN phase, but I chose not to for a practical reason:

**I needed to show you the wireframe results and get your approval before proceeding.**

If I had cleared context immediately after the agent finished:
- You wouldn't have seen the summary of what was created
- You wouldn't have been able to review/approve the wireframe list
- The workflow requires explicit user approval at each checkpoint

The right time to clear context would have been **after you approved the wireframes and before starting the PLAN phase** - but by that point, we were already in a continuous flow of approvals (wireframes â†’ epics â†’ stories), so clearing mid-conversation would have disrupted that.

**For future reference**, the ideal clear points are:
1. After DESIGN phase approval, before PLAN
2. After PLAN phase approval, before SPECIFY (tests)
3. After SPECIFY phase, before IMPLEMENT

Would you like me to proceed now with creating stories for the approved epics? I'll resume the feature-planner agent to break down Epic 1 into stories.

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:34Z)**_

I'll add the context clearing guidance after the Development Workflow section (before Quality Gate Policy). This fits well as it relates to the TDD workflow phases.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_



_Tools used: Edit_

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

I've added a new section "Context Clearing Between Phases" to CLAUDE.md with:

- A table showing ideal clear points between workflow phases
- How to clear (using `/clear` or starting new conversation with `/continue`)
- Why clearing is beneficial
- The important note about waiting for user approval before clearing

Now, shall I continue with creating stories for the approved epics? I'll resume the feature-planner agent to break down Epic 1 into stories.

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:36Z)**_

Yea commit the claude.md changes first then continue with creating stories for the approved epics

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:39Z)**_

Why did you not create a new branch for epic 1? I don't want you to do it now, I just want to know.


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Good question. You're right - I should have created a feature branch before starting work on Epic 1.

**Why I didn't:**

1. **The workflow instructions in `/start` didn't explicitly specify branch creation** - they focused on the agent handoffs (wireframes â†’ planning â†’ tests â†’ implementation) and commit policies, but didn't mention branching strategy.

2. **I was focused on the phase transitions** (DESIGN â†’ PLAN) rather than the Git workflow that should accompany them.

**What I should have done:**

Before starting any feature work, I should have:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/epic-1-start-page-report-batch
```

Or even better, created a branch for the entire Monthly Process feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/monthly-process
```

**Should this be documented in CLAUDE.md?**

I can add a "Git Branching Strategy" section that specifies:
- Create a feature branch before starting each epic (or the entire feature)
- Branch naming convention (e.g., `feature/epic-N-short-description`)
- When to create PRs
- Merge strategy

Would you like me to add this guidance to CLAUDE.md?

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-19 01:40Z)**_

Yes add this guidance to CLAUDE.md.  Commit Claude.md and the logs and then continue
