I'll analyze the current project state to determine where to resume the TDD workflow.

Let me read the PROGRESS.md and check the feature overview to understand the epic structure better.

Now let me check the current test files to see which stories they cover and run the tests to determine the current state.

Now I have a clear picture of the project state. Let me summarize:

## ðŸ“‹ TDD Workflow Analysis Complete

### Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Feature Spec** | âœ… Found in `documentation/` |
| **Wireframes** | âœ… 18 wireframes in `generated-docs/wireframes/` |
| **Stories** | âœ… 94 stories across 10 epics in `generated-docs/stories/` |
| **Test Files** | âœ… Epic 1-3 tests exist |

### Epic Status

| Epic | Name | Tests | Passing | Phase |
|------|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Epic 1** | Start Page & Report Batch Management | âœ… 5 stories | âœ… 154 passing | **IMPLEMENT** âœ… |
| **Epic 2** | Portfolio File Dashboard | âœ… 7 stories | â¸ï¸ 44 skipped | **IMPLEMENT** ðŸ”„ |
| **Epic 3** | Other Files Dashboard | âœ… 6 stories | â¸ï¸ 57 skipped | **IMPLEMENT** ðŸ”„ |
| Epic 4-10 | Remaining Epics | âŒ No tests | - | **SPECIFY** â³ |

### Test Results Summary
- **154 tests passing** (Epic 1 complete)
- **101 tests skipped** (Epic 2 & 3 tests waiting for implementation)
- **0 tests failing**

### ðŸ“ Resume Point

**Epic 1 is COMPLETE** - all tests passing. 

**Epic 2 (Portfolio File Dashboard)** has tests written but skipped - needs implementation.

**Epic 3 (Other Files Dashboard)** has tests written but skipped - needs implementation.

---

Would you like me to:

1. **Continue with Epic 2 implementation** - Start implementing the Portfolio File Dashboard components to make the 44 skipped tests pass
2. **Continue with Epic 3 implementation** - Start implementing the Other Files Dashboard components
3. **Run quality checks on Epic 1** - Verify Epic 1 passes all 5 quality gates before proceeding
4. **Generate tests for Epic 4+** - Continue the SPECIFY phase for remaining epics
