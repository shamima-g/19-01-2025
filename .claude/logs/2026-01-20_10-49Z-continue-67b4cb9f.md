### Files Modified This Session

1. [web/src/app/instruments/\[id\]/audit-trail/page.tsx](web/src/app/instruments/[id]/audit-trail/page.tsx) - Fixed Radix Select empty value issue
2. [web/src/__tests__/integration/instrument-audit-history.test.tsx](web/src/__tests__/integration/instrument-audit-history.test.tsx) - Enabled and fixed 19 tests
3. [web/src/__tests__/integration/instrument-popup.test.tsx](web/src/__tests__/integration/instrument-popup.test.tsx) - Rewrote tests to match row-click implementation (10 tests)

### Remaining Work for Epic 4

The following tests are still skipped:

1. **Story 4.2/4.3 (Add/Update Form)** - 14 skipped tests due to Radix Select component not working in jsdom. The implementation is complete, but tests require Select dropdown interaction which doesn't work in the test environment.

2. **Story 4.4 (File Upload)** - 15 skipped tests. The file upload page exists but the tests haven't been enabled yet.

3. **Story 4.7 (Export Incomplete)** - 1 skipped test. The "Export Incomplete ISINs" button hasn't been added to the grid yet.

### Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Update acceptance test checkboxes** in story files to mark completed tests?
2. **Commit the changes** made in this session?
3. **Continue implementing** the skipped tests (Story 4.4 File Upload)?
